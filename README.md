Gifta is a mock online store that fetches products from an API. With Gifta, users can browse products, search for specific items, and complete purchases. It is built using ReactJS with React Router, and it leverages React Hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useContext for state management. The app is responsive and easy to use, with an intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to find what they're looking for and complete their purchase.
